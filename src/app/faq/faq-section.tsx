  {
    question: "Is this Vedic (sidereal) or Western (tropical) astrology?",
    answer:
      "Sidereal — every chart uses the Lahiri (Chitrapaksha) ayanamsa, the standard reference for Vedic astrology across the Himalayan region and India.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to know my exact birth time?",
    answer:
      "It helps, but it's optional. Every planet's sign and nakshatra resolve correctly either way — only your Ascendant, house placements, and time-sensitive readings like Manglik Dosha from the Lagna need an exact birth time to appear.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who is the birth chart calculator for?",
    answer:
      "Anyone, anywhere. Vedic astrology works the same way for any birth date, time, and place worldwide — all the calculator needs is your coordinates and time zone, and the same real planetary positions get computed no matter where you were born.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is the Kirat Calendar the same thing as the astrology calculator?",
    answer:
      "No, they're separate. The birth chart calculator is Vedic astrology and works globally. The Kirat Khaik Mundhum Calendar is specific to the Kirat (Kiranti) community's own lunar-solar reckoning and festivals — Sakela, Chasok Tangnam, and the rest — followed mainly across Bhutan, Nepal, and the wider Himalayan Kirat diaspora.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's included in my Kundli report?",
    answer:
      "Your Lagna and Navamsa charts, a full Vimshottari Dasha timeline with sub-periods, Manglik and Kalsarpa Dosha checks, a Sadesati transit timeline, and a planetary strength breakdown — all calculated from real astronomical positions, not templated text.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my birth data private?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Your chart is calculated entirely in your browser — your birth details are never sent to or stored on any server.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is this free to use?",
    answer: "Yes — no account, no payment, and no limit on how many charts you generate.",
  },
