/**
 * The reference panchanga dataset is sparse and inconsistently shaped — most
 * days only carry a handful of fields, others carry Kirat-script ("K"-prefixed)
 * counterparts of nearly every field, and the Yenyem/Senlendat time-division
 * fields are accessed dynamically as `${prefix}${n}` (n = 1..12). An index
 * signature reflects the data honestly instead of pretending it's uniform.
